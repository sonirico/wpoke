    Im just a dummy wordpress site, with nothing at all to show. But hey! I
    have several links to my theme, both as links and scripts. Happy crawling!

    <script src="https://normal.wp.com/wp-content/hardcodedjs/main.js" >
        // This script should not be fetched when extracting candidate
        // theme urls
    </script>
