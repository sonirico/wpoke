    Im just a dummy wordpress site, with nothing at all to show. But hey! I
    have several links to my theme, both as links and scripts. Happy crawling!

    By the way! Im like <em>duplicates.html</em> but with duplicated urls! Will
    you be able to obtain an unique set of urls? I wonder...

    <script src="https://duplicates.wp.com/wp-content/hardcodedjs/main.js" >
        // This script should not be fetched when extracting candidate
        // theme urls
    </script>
    <script src="https://duplicates.wp.com/wp-content/themes/baskerville/js/main.js" ></script>
