Im just a dummy wordpress site, with nothing at all to show. But hey! I
have several links to my theme, both as links and scripts. Happy crawling!

<script src="//normal.wp.com/wp-content/hardcodedjs/main.js" >
    // This script should not be fetched when extracting candidate
    // theme urls
</script>
<script src="//normal.wp.com/wp-content/themes/unir.net/js/main.js" ></script>
</body>
